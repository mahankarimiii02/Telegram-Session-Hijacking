# How Does it work? 
* It uploads the **tdata folder** of Telegram into your github account. Then you can just download the folder and replace the current tdata folder with the new one in your telegram path 
* The tdata contains three critical files :
  1. key_data
  2. maps
  3. session related file
  
* It uses **wininet.dll** for creating an internet connection
