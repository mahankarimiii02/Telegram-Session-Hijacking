# How Does it work? 
* It uploads the tdata folder of Telegram Desktop to your github account. Then you can just download the tdata and replace the current tdata folder with the new one in your telegram path 
* The tdata contains three critical files :
    1. key_data
    2. maps
    3. session related file
